# Vulnerability Fixes for `vulnerable-share.tsx` and `poll-actions.ts`

This document outlines the vulnerabilities found in the `app/(dashboard)/polls/vulnerable-share.tsx` component and the solutions implemented to mitigate them.

## 1. Insecure URL Generation

- **Vulnerability**: The shareable URL was constructed using `window.location.origin`, which is a client-side value. This could be manipulated by an attacker, leading to open redirect vulnerabilities. An attacker could craft a malicious link that uses a different origin, and the share component would generate share links pointing to a malicious site.

- **Solution**: The base URL is now sourced from a server-side environment variable `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL`. This ensures that the base of the share URL is always a trusted, constant value, preventing any client-side manipulation. An `.env.local` file has been updated to include this variable.

## 2. Potential for Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

- **Vulnerability**: The `pollTitle` prop is used directly in the `mailto` and `twitter` share links. Although `encodeURIComponent` is used, it's best practice to treat all external data with caution. If the `pollTitle` contained malicious script content, it could be executed in a different context.

- **Solution**: While `encodeURIComponent` provides some protection, the more robust solution is to ensure that any user-generated content like `pollTitle` is properly sanitized upon input (e.g., when the poll is created or updated). For the scope of this component, we will continue to rely on `encodeURIComponent` as it is the correct function for encoding URL components, but the true fix lies in input sanitization further up the data flow. No code change is made for this in the component itself, but it is a critical vulnerability to be aware of in the application.

## 3. Information Leakage via `pollId`

- **Vulnerability**: The `pollId` is exposed in the URL. If the IDs are sequential or easily guessable (e.g., integers), an attacker could potentially discover and access other polls by iterating through IDs. This is a form of Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR).

- **Solution**: The backend should use non-sequential, random, and unique identifiers (like UUIDs) for polls. This makes it computationally infeasible for an attacker to guess other valid poll IDs. This is a backend consideration, and assuming a modern database or framework (like Supabase with UUIDs), this might already be in place. No change is made in the frontend component for this, but it's a key architectural consideration for security.

## 4. Unregistered and Unauthenticated Users can submit vote

- **Vulnerability**: The `submitVote` function allows any user, regardless of authentication status, to submit a vote. This could lead to vote manipulation or spam voting.

- **Solution**: The `submitVote` function has been updated to check if the user is authenticated before allowing them to submit a vote. If the user is not authenticated, an error message is returned, preventing the vote submission.
